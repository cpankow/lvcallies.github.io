Want to know more about the Allies?

<p>
At LVC meetings, we will all be wearing the official Ally badge, and encourage you to approach us at any time to talk about LVC Allies!
At any other time, we are reachable via email at <a href="mailto:lvcallies@gmail.com" target="_blank">lvcallies@gmail.com</a>, which is sent to the coordination team.

Interested in becoming an LVC Ally?
</h3>
<p>
We want to grow slowly and carefully.
The LVC Allies are currently invitation-only to ensure a thorough vetting process and to keep the Allies a safe place to everyone.
If you know one of the Allies, reach out to indicate your interest â€” we look forward to hearing from you.

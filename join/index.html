Want to know more about the Allies?
At LVC meetings, we will all be wearing the official Ally badge (perhaps a link to the badge here?), and encourage you to approach us at any time to talk about LVC Allies!
At any other time, we are reachable via email at <a href="mailto:lvcallies@gmail.com" target="_blank">lvcallies@gmail.com</a>, which is sent to the coordination team.

Interested in becoming an LVC Ally?
We want to grow slowly and carefully.
The LVC Allies are currently invitation-only to ensure a thorough vetting process and to keep the Allies a safe place to everyone.
If you know one of the Allies, reach out to indicate your interest â€” we look forward to hearing from you.

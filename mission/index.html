<p class="lead">The LVC Allies are a safe and confidential resource on dealing with harassment and bullying within the LVC. Our goal is to listen, foster an inclusive and harassment-free environment, and provide you with a safe space to discuss your options and how you want to proceed. We are a judgement-free zone.</p>

<p>Harassment and bullying in all forms are sadly all too present within our community, but it is important that we start a dialogue on these issues. More importantly, we must listen to our colleagues when they share their experiences. If you are uncomfortable, if it is unwanted; it is harassment. The Allies believe you, and will help you however we can. Anything you tell an Ally is kept confidential, and you are always in control of how you want to proceed. We are reactive, and help when we are called.</p>

<p>At LVC meetings, the Allies will have a focused presence at LVC-organised sessions and events. Worried about someone who makes you feel uncomfortable interacting with you while presenting a poster? We can be in the background discreetly, ready to intercept and change the conversation if needed. Overindulged at the party? We are on hand to help you get back to your hotel safely. Experiencing inappropriate behaviour from a colleague, and not sure how to proceed? Tell us your story, and we can help you explore your options confidentially - Allies will never act without your permission. Harassment is not something limited to collaboration meetings. We are available at all times via email at <a href="mailto:lvcallies@gmail.com">lvcallies@gmail.com</a>. Emails sent to this address are only seen by the Executive Committee, and will never be shared without your consent. It is important to note that Allies at your host institution may be mandatory reporters, but we will always be able to put you in contact with an Ally at a different institution to ensure confidentiality.</p>

<p>LVC collaboration members are changing physics history. The LVC Allies aim to foster an environment within the LVC that is worthy of its world-class researchers.</p>

The LVC Allies are a safe and confidential resource on dealing with harassment and bullying within the <a href="//ligo.org" target="_blank">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a> and the <a href="//www.ego-gw.it" target="_blank">Virgo Collaboration</a>.
Our goal is to listen, foster an inclusive and harassment-free environment, and provide you with a safe space to discuss your options and how you want to proceed.
We are a judgement-free zone.

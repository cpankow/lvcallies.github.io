The LVC Allies are a safe and confidential resource for all LVC members. Our goal is to foster an inclusive and harassment-free environment.
If you experience harassment or bullying, the LVC Allies will provide you with a safe space to discuss your options and how you want to proceed.
We are a judgement-free zone.
